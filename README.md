# Computaria\Tardis: Cache for people who drink

Cache calls without modifying your code. Make that slow call fast
in the easyest and fastest way possible so you have time do drink.
And keep drinking.

## Where the name comes from

We provide two reasons for the name, one for developers and one
for managers:

- Managers: Tardis makes slow things fast. Like a time machine
that travels to the slow future and brings it to the fast present.

- Developers: We love to drink and have a good time. Like Mussum
describing why you should use this library:

> "Nunca é tardis demais pra si faê a coisa certa..."
